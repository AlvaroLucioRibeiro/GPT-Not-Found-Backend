feat(events): implement full CRUD functionality with query parameters

Added full CRUD support for events with query parameter-based 
routing. Implemented `GET /events` to retrieve all events or 
a specific event by `event_id`. Developed `POST /events` for 
event creation with automatic data validation. Updated 
`PUT /events` to fetch `customer_id` dynamically and ensure 
proper updates. Refactored `DELETE /events` to verify event 
existence before removal, using `RETURNING id` for 
confirmation. Standardized error handling and response 
consistency across all endpoints.
