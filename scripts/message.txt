feat(orders): Implement CRUD operations for orders API  

Implemented the full CRUD functionality for the 
"orders" route, allowing users to create, 
retrieve, update, and delete orders associated 
with events. The `POST /orders` route was created 
to insert new orders into the database, while the 
`GET /orders` route allows fetching all orders or 
a specific one by its ID. The `PUT /orders` route 
enables updating existing orders with new details, 
and the `DELETE /orders` route allows removing 
orders from the system. Data validation was ensured 
using Pydantic models and query parameters, 
authentication middleware was integrated to restrict 
access to authenticated users, and standardized 
error handling with proper HTTP status codes was 
implemented to improve API responses.
