## Overview
This project provides an API for managing **events, orders, customers, payments, and invoices** for the Elo Drinks platform. The system is designed to streamline the process of event management, allowing users to create and manage events, place orders for drinks and services, process payments, and generate invoices.

The API is built using **FastAPI**, ensuring high performance and scalability. It integrates with **Supabase** as a database solution and utilizes **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation. The deployment is handled through **Vercel**, providing a seamless and efficient hosting environment.
